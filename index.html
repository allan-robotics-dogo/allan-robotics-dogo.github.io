                            My name is Allan Okeyo.  I am in my 2nd year of study pursuing B.Sc. Mechanical Engineering in Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). I enjoy learning and practicing Engineering because the principles and explorations in the field of Engineering have always intrigued me.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy the science behind moving objects and that is the reason behind me choosing to study Mechanical Engineering. I chose STEM subjects in secondary education level for assistance in me achieving my dreams of becoming an Engineer. Aside from studying Mechanical Engineering, I also study aeronautical engineering and in the past, I took some short courses in Aerodynamics and just recently have done a course in Flight Mechanics. I have also invested some time into programming. My expertise is with JAVA and C++.

                         <p>
                            I expect to learn many things in the field of robotics from Robotics Dojo competition such as design and manipulation of robots. I also expect to build my skill in teamwork and  know how to solve present time problems with robotic systems.
